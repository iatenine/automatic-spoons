# Group Project 1: Currency-Exchange-App

## Currency Exchange Application

### This interactive web application allows the user to view and compare currency exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and to view information for stocks and indices. When the user selects a date and currency to compare to the U.S. dollar, the data populates in a table on the page. The user can pin up to four rows of data. This data is stored in local storage until the user clears the data. In another section, the user can view current information for three major financial indices- this fetches most current information upon pageload. This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS and is powered by JavaScript and JQuery.
